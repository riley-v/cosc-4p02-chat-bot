Synopsis of Project:
In today’s day and age, everyone wants to have instant access to information. Nobody likes to search through webpages or fill out a form in order to get answers. They want to easily and quickly obtain their desired knowledge.
We are aiming to create a chat bot which meets all of the functional requirements of the end user. This is being achieved by creating a friendly UI and bot which is able to understand user needs and respond accordingly. The bot will allow for the end user to ask inquiries and attain information within a few keystrokes.
Software Engineering Method + Schedule:<br />
As per the requirements of the project, we will be using the Scrum engineering process. This means we will have two-week development sprints, each of which will implement a sprint backlog. The sprint backlogs are each composed of specific functionalities taken from the product backlog.
We will also have a weekly Scrum meeting on Wednesday after 6:00 pm. Our sprint review and sprint retrospective meetings will take place on Mondays at 4:30 pm during lecture time.
Project Topic: <br />
Brock University (Canada Games if we have time)
